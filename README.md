## Introduction

The News Aggregator Web App is a web application that allows users to aggregate and read news articles from various sources. This documentation provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting up and using the application.

## Installation

To run the project locally using Docker, follow these installation steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker (https://www.docker.com/)
- Git (https://git-scm.com/)

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-aggregator-app.git
   cd news-aggregator-app
   
   
2. Build a Docker image for the project:
   
   ```bash
   docker build -t news-aggregator-app .

3. Replace news-aggregator-app with a suitable image name.
    Run the Docker container for the application:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 3000:80 news-aggregator-app

    This command runs the application in a Docker container and maps port 3000 on your host machine to port 80 inside the container.

4. Access the application in a web browser:
    Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to view the running application.

5. To stop and remove the Docker container, use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker stop container-id

    Replace container-id with the actual container ID, which can be obtained using docker ps -a. After stopping the container, you can remove it using docker rm container-id.
